Coming soon.

### Setup

1. To being development run `npm install` first thing.
2. Install the `compass` ruby gem for sass to css conversion.

```
$ gem install compass --version 0.12.6
```

3. Add `export NODE_ENV=development` to your bashrc/zshrc file.
4. Run `npm run build` to build files.
5. Run `npm start` and you'll be live!

### Development

* Globally install nodemon by `npm install nodemon -g`
* Run `npm run build` or simply `gulp style` to build css files.
* Run `npm run dev` and hack! :)
